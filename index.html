    <p>My name is Asahd Khaled, and I'm the greatest human being of all time. My father, DJ Khaled is the best DJ in the scene currently, producing hit songs such as  I'm The One and Ad Astra. My favourite food is baby oatmeal and my favourite drink is my mom's milk. Those organic juices can never be compared to shitty milk in the market like Enfagrow, which is just disgusting.   </p>

    <p>Now that you know how badass I am, you can buy my album  <a href="https://djkhaled.shop.musictoday.com/store/" target='_blank'>here</a>. As you can see from my picture above, I do not fuck around. Buy the album or I will kill you myself.</p>
